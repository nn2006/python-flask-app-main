# Python Flask App

Requirement Summary
In this project, we will develop an Industrial Site Monitoring System that receives real-time data from sensors located at various points within the industrial site. The system will collect temperature, pressure, and steam injection readings and visualize their spatial distribution on a map using heatmaps. Additionally, the system will allow users to navigate through historical data to observe how the readings have changed over time.

 #1: Real-time Data Collection
To collect real-time data, we will implement a mechanism to receive data in JSON format from sensors. This can be achieved by setting up an API endpoint that the sensors can send their readings to. Here's an example of how to implement this in Python using the Flask framework:

language-python
 Copy code
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/data', methods=['POST'])
def receive_data():
    data = request.get_json()
    # Process the received data
    # Store the data in a database or perform any other required operations
    return 'Data received successfully'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
In this code, we define a Flask application and create an API endpoint at /api/data that accepts POST requests. The received data is processed and can be stored in a database or used for further analysis.

 #2: Heatmap Visualization
To visualize the spatial distribution of the collected data, we will implement heatmaps for each of the three parameters: temperature, pressure, and steam injection. We can use the Matplotlib library in Python to create the heatmaps. Here's an example of how to generate a heatmap using Matplotlib:

language-python
 Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
x = np.random.rand(100)
y = np.random.rand(100)
z = np.random.rand(100)

# Create a scatter plot with a color map
plt.scatter(x, y, c=z, cmap='hot')

# Add a color bar
plt.colorbar()

# Set labels and title
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.title('Heatmap')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
In this code, we generate sample data for the x, y, and z coordinates. We then create a scatter plot with a color map using the scatter function from Matplotlib. The c parameter is set to the z values to determine the color of each point. We add a color bar to indicate the color scale and set labels and a title for the plot.

 #3: Temporal Correlation
To implement temporal correlation, we will allow users to navigate through historical data and observe how the readings have changed over time. This can be achieved by storing the collected data in a database and retrieving it based on user input. Here's an example of how to implement this using the SQLite database in Python:

language-python
 Copy code
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('data.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Retrieve data for a specific time range
start_time = '2022-01-01 00:00:00'
end_time = '2022-01-02 00:00:00'
query = f"SELECT * FROM sensor_data WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '{start_time}' AND '{end_time}'"
cursor.execute(query)
data = cursor.fetchall()

# Process the retrieved data
for row in data:
    # Perform any required operations on the data

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
In this code, we connect to an SQLite database and retrieve data for a specific time range using a SQL query. The retrieved data can then be processed and used for further analysis or visualization.

Conclusion
In this project, we have developed an Industrial Site Monitoring System that collects real-time data from sensors and visualizes the spatial distribution of temperature, pressure, and steam injection readings using heatmaps. We have also implemented temporal correlation by allowing users to navigate through historical data. By following the provided code examples, you can build a robust system for monitoring and analyzing industrial site data.
